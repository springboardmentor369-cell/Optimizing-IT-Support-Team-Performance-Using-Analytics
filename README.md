# Supportlytics: Optimization of IT Support Team Performance using Advanced Analytics

## Problem Statement
IT support teams handle thousands of incident tickets daily, making it difficult to track workload distribution, resolution delays, and operational efficiency.  
This project transforms raw incident event logs into actionable insights using Python and Power BI to identify performance gaps and optimize support operations.

## Dataset Overview
Dataset used: Incident Management Process Enriched Event Log.

The raw event-based dataset was processed into a ticket-level analytical dataset.

Key attributes:
- Priority Levels
- Assignment Groups
- Resolution Time
- Incident Lifecycle

---

## KPIs Used
- Total Tickets
- Average Resolution Time
- Resolution Success %
- Resolution Speed Categories

---

## Dashboard Sections
1. Executive Overview – High-level KPIs.
2. Workload vs Performance – Priority-based analysis.
3. System Efficiency – Resolution speed distribution.
4. Team Performance – Assignment group workload insights.

---

## Key Insights
- Moderate priority tickets dominate workload.
- Low priority tickets show longer resolution durations.
- Majority of tickets resolve quickly but a long-tail of slow incidents impacts efficiency.
- Certain assignment groups handle significantly higher ticket volumes.

---

## Future Improvements
- Predictive resolution time modeling.
- Automation suggestions for repetitive incidents.
- Advanced clustering for root-cause analysis.
