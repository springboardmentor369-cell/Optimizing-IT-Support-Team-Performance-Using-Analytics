2. Project Detailed description: 
   - Description:
  1.Business Problem

    IT support teams often struggle with:

    High ticket backlog
    SLA breaches
    Uneven workload distribution
    Repeated incidents
    Low visibility into performance drivers
    Traditional reporting shows what happened. This solution reveals why it happened and what to fix next.
  2. Objective
  Build a Power BI analytics dashboard that:
  Tracks operational KPIs in real time
  Identifies bottlenecks in resolution workflow
  Predicts SLA risk

  Optimizes workload distribution

  Detects recurring root causes

  Recommends improvement opportunities

  3. Data Sources

  Example datasets:

  Ticket ID

  Created Date / Resolved Date

  Priority Level

  Category (Network, Software, Hardware, IAM, etc.)

  Assigned Engineer

  SLA Status

  Resolution Time

  Reopened Flag

  Customer Satisfaction Score

  Escalation Level

  Data can be imported from:

  Kaggle export

  Excel / CSV files
