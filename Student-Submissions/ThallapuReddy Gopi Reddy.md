2. Project Detailed description: 
   - Description:
 # 1.Business Problem
    IT support teams often struggle with:
    High ticket backlog
    SLA breaches
    Uneven workload distribution
    Repeated incidents
    Low visibility into performance drivers
    Traditional reporting shows what happened. This solution reveals why it happened and what to fix next.

# 2. Objective
  Build a Power BI analytics dashboard that:
  Tracks operational KPIs in real time
  Identifies bottlenecks in resolution workflow
  Predicts SLA risk
  Optimizes workload distribution
  Detects recurring root causes
  Recommends improvement opportunities

# 3. Data Sources
  Example datasets:
  Ticket ID
  Created Date / Resolved Date
  Priority Level
  Category (Network, Software, Hardware, IAM, etc.)
  Assigned Engineer
  SLA Status
  Resolution Time
  Reopened Flag
  Customer Satisfaction Score
  Escalation Level
  Data can be imported from:
  Kaggle export
  Excel / CSV files

# 4. Key KPIs
  Average Resolution Time
  First Response Time
  SLA Compliance %
  Ticket Volume by Category
  Reopen Rate
  Escalation Rate
  Agent Productivity Index
  Customer Satisfaction Score
  Backlog Trend
# 5. Dashboard Pages
 1️ Executive Overview
  Total Tickets (Open, Closed, Pending)
   SLA Compliance Gauge
   Resolution Time Trend
   High-Risk Ticket Indicator

 2️ Agent Performance Analytics
   Tickets per Engineer
   Avg Resolution Time by Agent
   Escalation Count
   Workload Distribution Heatmap
   Performance Ranking

  3️ Root Cause Intelligence
   Top Recurring Issues
   Category-based SLA Breach Analysis
   Reopened Tickets by Issue Type
   Incident Clustering

 4️ Predictive & Optimization Insights
  SLA Breach Risk Prediction
  Peak Volume Forecast
  Resource Allocation Suggestions
  Ticket Aging Analysis

# 6. Advanced Power BI Features
   DAX for SLA calculations
   Dynamic KPI cards
   Drill-through analysis
 Decomposition Tree for root cause analysis
 Forecasting using built-in analytics
 What-if parameters for staffing simulation

# 7. Business Impact
  20–35% faster resolution times
  Reduced SLA violations
  Balanced workload across agents
  Improved customer satisfaction
  Data-driven workforce planning

# 8. Innovation Angle
   Reimagine IT support as a data-driven performance engine, not a ticket queue.
   AI-driven anomaly detection
  Predictive staffing model
  Automated weekly performance reports
  Gamified leaderboard for engineers
  Early warning SLA alert dashboard
