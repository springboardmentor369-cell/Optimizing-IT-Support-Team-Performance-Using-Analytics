WEEK 6

DAX - DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSION

  * Measure - a scalar value
  * Sigma sign - shows they are measurable values

  * Discussed why daxx measure over built in fns
    • reusable
    • formattable

  * Difference b/w excel and PowerBI
    • Excel - static data
    • PowerBI - dynamic data

  * Implicit and Explicit fns in PowerBI
    • Implicit functions - in built functions
    • Explicit functions - the ones that we write

  ! * SPECIAL TIP :  USE MEASURES INSTEAD OF BUILT IN FUNCTIONS * !

  * Understanding some terms:
    • Revenue (the  money a company makes) = total profit + total cost
    • Profit - the money the company gains = Revenue - cost

  * Measure:
    • Measure is not a part of the table
    • To open measures - open square bracket 
    • We cannot directly do operations on a measure and a column from a table
    
    • Base Measure and Composite Measure
      ~ Base measure - measure created from the column of a table
      ~ Composite measure -measure created using basic measure 

  * Calculate measure:
    • to create multiple filters over  the  measure 
    • Syntax for calculate function:
      ~ Name = calculate (expression, filter)
      ~ Use columns in filter (not measures)
      ~ Expression - measure on which we have to perform the condition

  * Slicer 
    • to select only some part of data / to filter out data
    • Why calculate fn over slicer
      ~ Slicer function cannot override calculate
