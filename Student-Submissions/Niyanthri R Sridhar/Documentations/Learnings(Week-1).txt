Learnings (Week 1)

Project Introduction: Week 1 began with an overview of the Support Analytics project, which analyses IT ticketing data to evaluate service performance and operational efficiency.

We discussed the complete analytics pipeline:
Collect Data → Clean Data → Transform Data → Visualize & Analyze

This helped establish a structured workflow for approaching real-world analytics problems.

Data Analytics Workflow
Data Collection: The task assigned was to collect IT ticketing data for analysis.
While data can be extracted directly from databases using SQL, in this case we worked with structured formats such as:
- CSV files
- Excel files
- SQL exports

Database: A database is an organised collection of structured data stored for management, retrieval, updating, and control.


Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data preparation was performed using:
1. Python (Pandas) → For cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming the data
2. Power Query (Power BI) → For data shaping and transformation within dashboards

Key activities included:
- Removing irrelevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Extracting only required features
- Structuring data for analysis

We learned that:
- Cleaning and transformation are crucial before visualization.
- Only relevant and meaningful data should be retained for effective analysis.

Data Visualisation - done using Power BI.

Important distinctions learned:
Reports → Static representation of data
Dashboards → Dynamic and interactive
For time-based data (like ticket trends),
A line chart is commonly used to visualise time series patterns.

Framing the Analysis
- A major learning this week was understanding how to frame analytics work properly.
- Before building a dashboard, we must:
1. Understand the dataset thoroughly
2. Identify the business questions being answered
3. Define the problem statement
4. Determine what insights stakeholders need

We also learned that dashboards can contain multiple pages, each serving a purpose:
Page 1 → Explain the dataset
Page 2 → Define the problem and need for analysis
Page 3 → Present solutions and insights through visuals

Note: The goal is not just visualisation, but building an optimal dashboard tailored to the company’s operational needs.


Final Presentation Requirements
1. Proper documentation of the project
2. Uploading all relevant files to GitHub
3. Ensuring dashboards are interactive and user-friendly

- Understood the complete data analytics lifecycle.
- Learned the importance of data cleaning before visualisation.
- Recognised the difference between static reports and interactive dashboards.
- Developed clarity on how to frame business questions.
- Understood how dashboards must align with company objectives.
