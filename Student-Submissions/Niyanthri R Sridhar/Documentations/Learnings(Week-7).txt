Learnings (Week 7)

This week focused on shifting from technical execution to analytical thinking and business storytelling.

Before building dashboards or writing DAX, it is important to ask:
1. What is the purpose of this analysis?
2. Who is the audience?
3. What business problem are we solving?
4. What decisions will be made from this dashboard?

Key reminder:
- A dashboard without purpose is just decoration.
- Technical readiness also matters:
- Be comfortable with Python and data cleaning
- Understand DAX measures
- Be clear on all previous concepts (data modelling, KPIs, relationships)


Explaining Technical Insights to Non-Technical Stakeholders
- A good data analyst makes complex data simple to understand.
- For stakeholders who do not understand technical terms:
1. Focus on business impact
2. Explain trends using real-world language
3. Connect numbers to outcomes


Evaluating a Visual
- Is it clearly interpreting the data?
- Is the insight immediately visible?
- Is it cluttered or clean?
- Are colours consistent?
- Is it visually appealing?

Key principles:
- Use consistent colour schemes

- Ensure readability
- Highlight important metrics
- Good visualization = clarity + simplicity + consistency.
