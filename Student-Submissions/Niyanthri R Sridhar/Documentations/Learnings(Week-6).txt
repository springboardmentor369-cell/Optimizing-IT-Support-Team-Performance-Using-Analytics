Learnings (Week 6)

This week focused on understanding DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI and how measures are created for dynamic calculations.

What is DAX?
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI for:
- Creating measures
- Creating calculated columns
- Building calculated tables
- Performing advanced aggregations
- DAX allows dynamic calculations based on filters and user interaction.


What is a Measure?
- A measure is a calculation performed on data that:
- Returns a single scalar value
- Is evaluated dynamically based on filters
- Is used mainly in visuals
Example: Total Tickets = COUNTROWS('Fact_Ticket')


Important Notes About Measures
- A measure is a scalar value (returns one result at a time).
- Measures are not visible in Data/Table view — only in Report view.
- Measures are calculated at query time (dynamic).
- Tables must be properly connected for measures to work correctly.
- Measures offer greater flexibility and formatting control compared to static columns.

Sigma (Σ) Symbol
- The Σ (Sigma) symbol represents numeric/measurable fields.
- These fields can be aggregated (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, etc.).

Implicit vs Explicit Measures
- Implicit Measures: Automatically created when you drag a numeric column into a visual.
Example: SUM(Sales) - These are basic and limited in control.

- Explicit Measures: Created manually using DAX. Offer better control, flexibility, and reusability.
Example: Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Amount]) - Explicit measures are preferred in professional dashboards.


Types of Measures
- Base Measure: A measure created directly from a column.
- Composite Measure: A measure built using other measures. It promotes modular and reusable design.


CALCULATE Function: It is one of the most powerful DAX functions.
Purpose:
- Modifies filter context
- Applies multiple filters to a calculation
Example:
High Priority Tickets =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('Fact_Ticket'),
    'Fact_Ticket'[Priority] = "High"
)
This calculates ticket count only for high-priority tickets.

Slicer: A Slicer is a visual filter in Power BI that allows users to:
- Filter data interactively
- Change report context dynamically
- Slicers directly affect how measures are calculated and displayed.

Types of slicers:
- Dropdown
- List
- Date range
- Between filter
- Relative date filter


* Key Takeaways from Week 6
- Understood the purpose and structure of DAX
- Learned how to create dynamic measures
- Differentiated between implicit and explicit measures
- Understood base and composite measures
- Learned how CALCULATE() modifies filter context
- Recognised the importance of slicers in interactive dashboards
- Calculate Function: It allows applying multiple filters on the same measure.
- Slicer: It is used to filter data in a visual. It also consists of multiple types.
