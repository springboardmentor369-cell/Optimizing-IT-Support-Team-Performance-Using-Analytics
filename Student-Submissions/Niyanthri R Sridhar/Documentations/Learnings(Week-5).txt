Learnings (Week 5)

This week focused on understanding data modelling, relationships between tables, and foundational data warehouse concepts used in analytics and Power BI.

Data Modelling – Relationships Between Tables
- Understanding relationships is crucial for building accurate dashboards and avoiding incorrect aggregations.
1. Many-to-Many (*:*): Multiple records in both tables relate to multiple records in the other table.
Example:
Students and Courses
A student can enroll in multiple courses
A course can have multiple students

2. Many-to-One (*:1): Many records in one table relate to a single record in another table.
Example:
Employees → Department
Many employees belong to one department

3. One-to-Many (1:*): One record in a table relates to multiple records in another table.
Example:
Customer → Orders
One customer can place many orders

4. One-to-One (1:1): One record in a table relates to exactly one record in another table.
Example:
Person → Passport
One person has one passport


Types of Data
- Understanding data types helps in selecting correct visualizations and statistical methods.
1. Numerical Data
- Represents measurable quantities
- Can be continuous or discrete
- Used for aggregation (sum, average, count).
Examples: Age, Salary, Revenue

2. Categorical Data
- Represents labels or groups
- Cannot be mathematically calculated
- Used for grouping and filtering.
Examples: Gender, Country, Ticket Status

3. Time Series Data
- Data collected over time intervals
- Used for: trend analysis, forecasting, seasonality detection
Examples: Monthly Sales, Daily Tickets


Primary Key & Foreign Key
Essential for relational database design and Power BI modelling.
Primary Key (PK): A column that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- Must be unique
- Cannot be NULL
- Only one primary key per table
Example: Customer_ID in the Customer table

Foreign Key (FK): A column that creates a relationship between two tables by referencing a primary key.
- Can contain duplicate values
- Can be NULL (depending on business logic)
- Links to a primary key in another table
Example: Customer_ID in Orders table → references Customer table

KPI (Key Performance Indicator): A measurable value used to evaluate how effectively a business or process is achieving its objectives.
(KPIs convert raw data into business performance indicators.)
Examples: Average Resolution Time, Revenue Growth


Fact and Dimension Tables
Fact Table
- Stores measurable, quantitative data
- Contains numeric values
- Includes foreign keys to dimension tables
Examples: Sales Amount, Ticket Resolution Time
Fact tables answer: “What happened?” and “How much?”

Dimension Table
- Stores descriptive or contextual information
- Used for filtering and grouping
Examples: Customer details, Product category
Dimension tables answer: “By whom?” “Where?” “When?” “What category?”


Star Schema: 
- One central fact table
- Multiple dimension tables
- All dimensions connect directly to the fact table
- The layout resembles a star

Advantages of star schema:
- Simple structure
- Easy to understand
- Efficient for reporting and analytics
- Ideal for Power BI modelling


* Key Takeaways from Week 5
- Understood different types of table relationships.
- Learned the importance of primary and foreign keys.
- Gained clarity on fact vs dimension tables.
- Learned how a star schema improves analytics performance.
- Strengthened foundational data warehousing knowledge.
