Learnings (Week 2)

Understanding the Difference: Python vs Power BI
This week focused on understanding when and why to use Python versus Power BI in analytics workflows.

Power BI
- Primarily used for visualisation and dashboard creation
- Easy to use and business-friendly
- Suitable for quick analysis
- Not ideal for real-time or automated processing
- Limited reusability outside the dashboard environment

Python
- More flexible and powerful for data processing
- Enables building reusable ETL pipelines (Extract → Transform → Load)
- Supports automation
- Better suited for large-scale data manipulation
- Ideal for preprocessing before visualization

Key Learning: Power BI is excellent for presenting insights, while Python is stronger for backend processing, automation, and scalable data workflows.


Data Assumptions
- In most real-world cases, assumptions about data should be avoided.
- Only in rare situations, where domain logic justifies it, can controlled assumptions be made.
- Any assumption must be documented clearly.
- This ensures data integrity and analytical reliability.

Data Type Importance: A critical concept learned was the importance of correct data types.
Example: 
- Phone numbers must be stored as text, not integers.
- If stored as integers, leading zeros (e.g., "0123456789") will be removed.
- This highlights why proper schema understanding is important before cleaning.


Cleaning Environment
Data cleaning was performed in VS Code using the Jupyter Notebook extension, allowing:
- Step-by-step execution
- Easy debugging
- Clear visibility of intermediate outputs
- This approach improves traceability and reproducibility.


Key Definitions Learned
- Libraries: Pre-written collections of functions and modules that help perform common tasks efficiently.
Example: Pandas, NumPy.
- DataFrame: A tabular data structure (rows and columns) with labeled axes, commonly used in Pandas for data manipulation.
- Index: The row labels of a DataFrame. By default, range from 0 to n-1
- NaN: Represents missing or empty values in numerical columns.
- N/A: Represents null or unavailable values (often categorical).
- drop_duplicates(): Removes duplicate rows from a dataset.
- drop(columns=[]): Removes unwanted columns from a dataset.
- strip(): Removes leading/trailing spaces or unwanted characters from text values.
- Standardisation: Ensuring consistent formatting in categorical variables.
Example: Convert all variations of: Y/Yes/yes/y into a single standardised value like "Yes".


*Key Takeaways from Week 2
- Understood the complementary roles of Python and Power BI.
- Learned why data types must be handled carefully.
- Improved practical data cleaning skills.
- Strengthened understanding of missing values and standardisation.
- Recognised the importance of reusable and automated workflows.
