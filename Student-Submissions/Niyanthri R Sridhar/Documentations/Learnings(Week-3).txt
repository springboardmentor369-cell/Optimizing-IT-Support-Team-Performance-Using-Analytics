Learnings (Week 3)

Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Week 3 focused on understanding and applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

EDA is the process of analysing datasets to:
- Summarise key characteristics
- Detect patterns
- Identify anomalies
- Discover relationships
- Support business decision-making
- It bridges raw data and meaningful insights.

An example 4-Step Framework for Data Analysis
- Step 1: Transform and Clean the Data
Before analysis, it is critical to understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
Key questions to ask:
1. What is the volume of data?
2. How many rows and columns are present?
3. What are the data types and categories?
4. Where is the data sourced from?
5. Is the dataset structured or unstructured?
6. Are there missing or inconsistent values?
Goal: Understand the dataset fully before concluding.

- Step 2: Identify and Handle Outliers
Outliers can distort analysis and visualisations.
Tasks include:
1. Detecting extreme values
2. Deciding whether to remove, cap, or investigate them
3. Understanding if the outlier represents an error or a real phenomenon
Important: Outliers should not be removed blindly — business context matters.

- Step 3: Compare the Data
Comparison helps identify performance differences.
Comparative analysis reveals trends and performance gaps.

- Step 4: Identify Relationships
Understanding relationships between variables helps uncover deeper insights.
Examples:
1. Does content type influence subscriber retention?
2. Does geography affect content production?
This step moves analysis from descriptive to analytical thinking.


Case Study: Netflix Data Analysis
1. Is the platform more focused on TV Shows or Movies?
Business Insight: TV Shows encourage long-term retention.

2. Where is the content produced? Which international markets are being targeted?
Goal: Identify growth beyond the US. Understand the global penetration strategy. Analyse emerging markets.

3. How soon is content reaching the platform after release?
Key Insight: Faster streaming releases may align with evolving consumer behaviour.

4. What are the most common genres? Do they align with high-growth countries?
This helps evaluate: Market demand alignment and cultural adaptation strategy.

5. Does the content align with the target audience?
Example: If the company promotes a “Family Plan,” Is there sufficient family-oriented content?
