# Week- 6
* What is DAX?
  - DAX stands for data analysis expressions and it is used to create Measures, Calculated Columns and Tables.


* Fact table mean : it contains measurable data
  - In powerbi summation stands for measurable column.
* From sales dataset we learned DAX formula's:
  - Total Profit = Sum(FactSales[Profit])


* Implicit functions
  - automatically created by Power Bi using built-in aggreations like Sum, Count, and Average.
  - implict function don't have control over data
* Explict functions 
  - created by using DAX formulas, 
  - this functions give full access to control over data and
    modification of values.


* Differnce between Revenue and Profit 
  - Revenue: All the money company earns by selling.
  - Profit: Money left after paying all expenses.


* Base Measure
  - It is a measure created using column from table
* Composite measure
  - it is a column created by combining the two measures columns.


* Slicer
  - slicer is a visual filtering tool
  - it allows to filter data


* filter 
  - is a Dax function that returns a table with rows if given condition is satisfied. 
  - filter is used inside CALCULATE() to apply row level conditions for result


* Formulas:  
  - Total profits from manager = 
                         CALCULATE(
                         [Total Profit],
                         DimEmployee[Role] = 'manager'
                         DimDate[year] = 2018
                         )

 - If Condition Formula:
            Target = if(
                     [Total Revenue] > 2000000,
                     "Target Reached",
                     "failed"
                      )

* Additional we learned commonly used DAX functions, including
 - if-else 
 - nested if
