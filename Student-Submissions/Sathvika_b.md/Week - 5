# week-5
* What is KPI
 - KPI stands for key performance indicator and it is a measurable value that tells us
   how somthing well performed compared to a goal.


* What are the different data available in datasets, those are :
 - Continuous data 
 - Categorical data
 - Time Based data
 - Continuous Data :  
   Is a numerical data where we can perform mathematical operations like mean ,median and mode etc...
   and also to Visualize this data we use Cards and Histogram plot , Cards shows numerical value and
   Histogram wrok on ranges.
 - Categorical Data :
   Is a data that divides data into groups like males and females of gender data and also to visualize
   this data we use Bar plot and Pie chart , Bar plot is used to compare between categories 
   and Pie chart is used to represent the Categories in percentages.
   Pie chart proportion = 100 and it doesn't used to exact count. 
 - Time Based Data : 
   Time Based data means values varying over time or duration example gold price may decreases or increases completely 
   varying day by day . And to visualize this data we use line plot because line plot implies a sequence.


* Then after we learnt what is primary and foreign keys 
 - Primary key : 
   It is a column in table that contains unique values and doesnot contain null and duplicate values.
 - Foreign key : 
   It is a column in table that refer to primary key of another table.


* What is fact and dimension table : 
 - fact table : 
   It contains the main metrics of data.
 - dimension table :
   It contains complete details of customers and produts.


* Next we establish connnection between tables through primary key and observed relation between table as
 - 1 to many(*)
 - many(*) to 1


* Next we took Sales Data Example in Power Bi 
 - We observed how tables are connnected to each other and relation among the tables.


* Data Modeling:
 - How data organised in structured way, stored and relationship between data then
   making data ready for analysis and reporting  
 - Star Schema : 
   it is used to make reports efficient, fast and easy to analyze.


Task : find out which is primary and foreign key in fact and dimension table
   -  A fact table doesnot contain single primary key, instead we use composite primary key , it is combination of
      both customerid and productid.
   -  Here customerid and productid  are columns in fact table refering to customerid of dimension table ,productid of
      dimension table with respectively.
