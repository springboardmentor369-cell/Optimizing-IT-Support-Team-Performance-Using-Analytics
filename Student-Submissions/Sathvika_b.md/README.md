# OPTIMIZING IT SUPPORT TEAM PERFORMANCE USING ANALYTICS


# 📌 Project Overview
---
 This project focuses on analyzing IT support ticket data to evaluate and improve the performance of an IT support team. 
 By using data analytics techniques, the project aims to understand ticket patterns, measure team efficiency,
 and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance service quality and response time.

# ❔ Problem statement  
---
IT support teams often handle a large volume of tickets with varying priorities and complexities. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:
- Identify high-risk categories
- Detect regional workload imbalance
- Monitor resolution efficiency
- Reduce ticket backlog
   
This project aims to solve these challenges using data analytics and visualization

# 📁 Dataset Description
---
The dataset contains 50 rows and 7 columns of IT support tickets and it a API data. Each record represents a support request raised 
by end-users include details such as the ticket creation time, resolution time, ticket status and priority level.
key attributes are :
- Ticket ID
- Tickets Category
- Tickets Country
- Ticket Creation_at
- Tickets Priority
- Tickets Resolution time
- Tickets Status

# 📉 KPIs & Metrics
---
- Total Tickets Count
- Status-wise Ticket Count
- Average Resolution time
- Priority-wise Distribution
- Category-wise Ticket Volume



# 🎞️ Analysis Approach
---
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Handling missing and inconsistent values.
- Removing white spaces and special characters.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Power Bi for visualization and Dashboard creation

- Recommendations:
- To improve IT support team efficiency:
- provide more training for agents to solve security related issues
- give more priority to solving of high priority tickects
- Allocate more agents across regional wise to workloads

# 📍 Key insights
---
- Login Issues and Server Down incidents contribute significantly to total tickets.
- Certain countries generate higher ticket volumes, indicating workload imbalance.
- High and Urgent priority tickets requries faster escalation.
- Open and Pending tickets represent operational backlog.
- Resolution time differnces indicate potential process bottlenecks. 


# 🔍 Tools used
---
- Python : Used for data cleaning and Preprocessing
- Pandas : Used for loading and handling the datasets
- Excel  : Intial data inspection
- vscode/jupyter Notebook
- Power Bi : Used for visualization and creation of Dashboard


# 🚀 Bussiness Impact
---
Using this dashboard, IT management can:
- Prioritize high-risk categories
- Reduce resolution delays
- Optimize resourse allocation
- Improve overall support efficiency
# 📌 Conclusion
---
This project analyzes IT support ticket data to understand team performance and workload. 
The dashboard helps identify high-priority issues, backlog tickets, and resolution delays.
Using these insights, the IT team can improve efficiency and make better decisions.
