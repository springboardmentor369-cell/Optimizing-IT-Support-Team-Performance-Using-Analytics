-Project Detailed Description


Cleaned and transformed raw ticket data using Power Query

Created star schema with Fact and Dimension tables

Built DAX measures for KPIs such as:

Total Tickets Assigned

Total Tickets Resolved

Open Tickets

SLA Compliance %

Average Resolution Time

Resolution Efficiency %


-Designed two dashboards:


Operational Overview – overall workload, SLA health, ticket distribution

Agent Performance & Quality – individual agent efficiency, resolution time, reopen rate, workload by issue type

Added slicers for Agent, Issue Type, and Priority for interactive analysis

Used conditional formatting and consistent color themes for readability


-Business Value

Helps management track service quality in real time

Identifies agents needing support or training

Highlights issue types causing SLA breaches

Supports data-driven decisions to improve resolution speed and customer satisfaction
