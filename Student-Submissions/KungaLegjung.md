### Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics

**Description:**  
In this project, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze IT support service data and evaluate team performance. I integrated data using an API and created interactive visuals to monitor ticket volume, response time, resolution trends, and team efficiency. The dashboard helps identify performance gaps and supports data-driven decision-making for IT support management.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Integrated data using API key for automated data retrieval  
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query  
- Designed interactive visuals to track KPIs and performance trends  
- Applied structured dashboard flow for effective communication
